###Week 1
The first week was fine. I think my main trouble was with the shaper function. 
Also I had trouble understanding what the third question was about...


###Week 2
I'm proud that I successfully did the simulation of the crystalls on window 
But I had trouble understaind what the thrid questions was asking us to do

###Week 3
