###Prototype 1
Demo video link:

My goal is to create 4-5 different renditions of the same painting Starry night by incorporating what we have learned. For prototype I've tried noise, field, mesh, and image processing.

For next prototype, I will explore the effect of particle movements, maybe using sin/cos to create rhythmic movement. I also want to explore shader for the final version.
